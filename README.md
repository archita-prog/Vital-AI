| /predict/diabetes    | XGBoost      | ROC-AUC     | SHAP          | BMI, pulse ratios, polynomial and interaction terms |
| /predict/heart       | SVM          | ROC-AUC     | -             | Clinical & derived features        |
| /predict/bloodsugar  | CatBoost     | -           | -             | Advanced ratios, interaction terms |

 Features

- Multiple specialized models for diabetes, heart disease, and blood sugar prediction.
- Advanced feature engineering for all endpoints:
- BMI, pulse ratios, clinical interactions, and polynomial features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation heatmaps to ensure medically relevant features.
- Model evaluation with ROC-AUC metrics for classification tasks.
- Interpretability SHAP values for diabetes model, enabling transparency for clinicians.
- Modular preprocessing pipelines: Imputation, scaling, and encoding, serialized via joblib for reusable, robust deployment.
- REST API with FastAPI: Real-time, scalable access to all models.
- Easy integration into digital health platformsâ€”input/output via JSON.

Technical Workflow
